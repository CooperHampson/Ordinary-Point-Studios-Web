            We focus on the development of micro games, often sold through steam. Small projects are the main focus point of the game development aspect of the business, although occasionally we will work on larger scaled projects. If you wish to see all the current games being developed and/or currently listed on steam, head on over to our Games tab on the sidebar. Each game we have developed is listed there along with all relevant information about the game such as what it is about, price and more.
